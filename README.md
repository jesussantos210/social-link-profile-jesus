## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- Mobile-First Approach
- **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**
- Flexbox (for centering and button alignment)
- **`rem` units** (for a scalable and accessible design)
- **A11y (Accessibility) practices**


### What I learned

This section captures my progress and key takeaways from the project:

> With this project, I felt much more comfortable, allowing me to complete it in **record time**. Unlike the previous project (the blog card) where I was lost all the time, for this challenge, I had a **complete notion** of where I started and where I wanted to go.
>
> **Consolidated Learnings and Challenges:**
>
> 1. **Mastering Flexbox Layout:** I was able to instantly center the card and align all elements (buttons, avatar, text) using simple `display: flex` properties.
> 2. **Organizing CSS Variables (The Initial Challenge):** Although using CSS variables in `:root` is the correct approach, I initially struggled with the **logical organization of colors** (which colors should be `primary`, `secondary`, and `accent`). I had to research to correctly define the color hierarchy so that the `hover` effects and readability were consistent. This process strengthened my understanding of professional CSS architecture.
> 3. **Accessibility:** I learned the importance of the **`:focus` state** for keyboard navigation and the necessity of using the **`prefers-reduced-motion` media query** to disable transitions for accessibility compliance.
> 4. **Professional Hover State:** I implemented a single `:hover` state that simultaneously changed the button's background and text color, providing a professional and clean user experience.
> 5. **Font Weight Control:** I was able to finely tune the font weight to **`font-weight: 650;`** to achieve the perfect visual contrast on the dark background.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on pushing my skills beyond basic mark-up:

**HTML and CSS Fluency:** Making the coding process fully *fluid and intuitive*, minimizing the need to research basic rules.

**Transition to JavaScript:** Beginning to use *JavaScript (JS)* to add real interactivity and logic to my web projects.

**Advanced Adaptive Design:** Mastering *Media Queries* and concepts like *CSS Grid* to ensure my designs are fully responsive and accessible on all devices, including using `prefers-reduced-motion` as a standard accessibility practice.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - Constant reference for `flexbox` and `transition` syntax.
